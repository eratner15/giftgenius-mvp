# 🚀 GiftGenius MVP Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy Instructions

### Step 1: GitHub Repository
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it `giftgenius-mvp`
3. Make it **public** (so your co-founder can see it)
4. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have files)

### Step 2: Push Code to GitHub
```bash
cd "/home/evanratner/projects/Gift Genius/giftgenius-mvp"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/giftgenius-mvp.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Deploy Backend to Railway
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign up with GitHub
2. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select your `giftgenius-mvp` repository
4. **Important:** Set the root directory to `backend`
5. Railway will auto-deploy the backend API
6. Copy the Railway domain (e.g., `https://giftgenius-backend.up.railway.app`)

### Step 4: Deploy Frontend to Netlify
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up with GitHub
2. Click "Add new site" → "Import from Git"
3. Select your `giftgenius-mvp` repository
4. **Set build settings:**
   - Base directory: `frontend`

   - Build command: `echo "No build required"`
5. Deploy the site
6. Netlify will give you a URL like `https://magical-name-123456.netlify.app`

### Step 5: Update Frontend API URL
1. Edit `frontend/public/index.html`
2. Find line 102: `const API_BASE_URL = window.location.hostname === 'localhost'`
3. Replace the Railway URL with your actual backend URL:
   ```javascript
   const API_BASE_URL = window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       ? 'http://localhost:3001'
       : 'https://YOUR-RAILWAY-BACKEND-URL.up.railway.app';
   ```
4. Commit and push the change
5. Netlify will auto-redeploy
