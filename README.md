## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)
```
DATABASE_URL=./giftgenius.db
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Frontend Configuration
- API proxy to http://localhost:3001
- React via CDN (no build step)
- Auto CORS headers

## 🧑‍💻 Development Notes

### Key Design Decisions:
1. **SQLite over PostgreSQL:** Easier setup, no external dependencies
2. **Inline React:** No build process, faster iteration
3. **CDN Dependencies:** No npm install for frontend
4. **Testimonial-driven:** Core value prop is peer validation

### Performance Optimizations:
- Images lazy load from Unsplash CDN
- API responses cached in memory
- Minimal JavaScript bundle size
- Touch-optimized interface

## 📈 Analytics Dashboard

Visit http://localhost:3001/api/analytics/summary for:
- Top viewed gifts in last 7 days
- Conversion funnel (views → clicks)
- Category performance
- Session analytics

## 🎁 Sample Gift Data

The database includes diverse, realistic gifts:
- **Jewelry:** Star map necklaces, birthstone bracelets
- **Experiences:** Spa days, cooking classes, hot air balloons
- **Home:** Silk pillowcases, photo frames, cutting boards
- **Beauty:** Makeup sets, skincare fridges, bath bombs
- **Tech:** AirPods, Polaroid cameras, smart bracelets
- **Unique:** Custom songs, star naming, adventure books

## 🚫 Known Limitations (MVP Scope)

- No user authentication (anonymous only)
- No testimonial submission (read-only)
- No payment processing
- Images from Unsplash (not actual products)
- Basic responsive design (not polished)
- SQLite database (not production-ready)

## 🔄 Next Features (Post-MVP)

3. Advanced recommendation engine
4. Partner preference quiz
5. Email/SMS gift reminders
6. Social sharing features

- Click-through rate to affiliates (target: 10%+)
- Filter usage patterns (do users prefer high success rates?)
- Mobile usability (smooth experience at 375px width)
